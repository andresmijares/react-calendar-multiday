If `g` is as above and `_` is [`R.__`](#__),\n * the following are equivalent:\n *\n *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.5.0\n * @category Function\n * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n * @see R.curry\n * @example\n *\n *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n *\n *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n *      var g = f(3);\n *      g(4); //=> 10\n */\n\n\nvar curryN = /*#__PURE__*/_curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n  if (length === 1) {\n    return _curry1(fn);\n  }\n  return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n});\nmodule.exports = curryN;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/ramda/src/curryN.js\n ** module id = 7\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","function _has(prop, obj) {\n  return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, prop);\n}\nmodule.exports = _has;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/ramda/src/internal/_has.js\n ** module id = 8\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var _curry2 = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_curry2');\n\nvar _dispatchable = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_dispatchable');\n\nvar _map = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_map');\n\nvar _reduce = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_reduce');\n\nvar _xmap = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_xmap');\n\nvar curryN = /*#__PURE__*/require('./curryN');\n\nvar keys = /*#__PURE__*/require('./keys');\n\n/**\n * Takes a function and\n * a [functor](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land#functor),\n * applies the function to each of the functor's values, and returns\n * a functor of the same shape.\n *\n * Ramda provides suitable `map` implementations for `Array` and `Object`,\n * so this function may be applied to `[1, 2, 3]` or `{x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`.\n *\n * Dispatches to the `map` method of the second argument, if present.\n *\n * Acts as a transducer if a transformer is given in list position.\n *\n * Also treats functions as functors and will compose them together.\n *\n * @func\n * @memberOf R\n * @since v0.1.0\n * @category List\n * @sig Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b\n * @param {Function} fn The function to be called on every element of the input `list`.\n * @param {Array} list The list to be iterated over.\n * @return {Array} The new list.\n * @see R.transduce, R.addIndex\n * @example\n *\n *      var double = x => x * 2;\n *\n *      R.map(double, [1, 2, 3]); //=> [2, 4, 6]\n *\n *      R.map(double, {x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}); //=> {x: 2, y: 4, z: 6}\n * @symb R.map(f, [a, b]) = [f(a), f(b)]\n * @symb R.map(f, { x: a, y: b }) = { x: f(a), y: f(b) }\n * @symb R.map(f, functor_o) = functor_o.map(f)\n */\n\n\nvar map = /*#__PURE__*/_curry2( /*#__PURE__*/_dispatchable(['fantasy-land/map', 'map'], _xmap, function map(fn, functor) {\n  switch (Object.prototype.toString.call(functor)) {\n    case '[object Function]':\n      return curryN(functor.length, function () {\n        return fn.call(this, functor.apply(this, arguments));\n      });\n    case '[object Object]':\n      return _reduce(function (acc, key) {\n        acc[key] = fn(functor[key]);\n        return acc;\n      }, {}, keys(functor));\n    default:\n      return _map(fn, functor);\n  }\n}));\nmodule.exports = map;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/ramda/src/map.js\n ** module id = 9\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var _curry2 = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_curry2');\n\nvar _equals = /*#__PURE__*/require('./internal/_equals');\n\n/**\n * Returns `true` if its arguments are equivalent, `false` otherwise.
